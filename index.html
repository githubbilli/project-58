		<p id = "cube_information">My favorite hobby is cubing which is to solve rubiks cubes.<br>I have collected 14 of these cubes which I solve every once in a while.<br>So it usually takes me about 2 to 10 minutes to solve one of these.<br>Some of these are 3*3, 4*4, mirror cube, 3*4 and barrel cube.<br>I like cubing because it is quite fun and it is also considered as a stress<br> reliver even though i dont always use as a stress reliver.<br>My favorite cube is the 3*3 beacause it is the first and most important cube</p>
